# JANQ Smart Home Solution
With this system you can connect any LOT device there is, with the given protocol. Like a ESP8266/ESP32.
The server consists of a Raspberry pi and a router, that uses udp for responses and handling requests,
### WHY?
Why indeed, this is basically for me to learn about LOT devices and - in the future - sending information securely. I just needed a (sort of)solid platform to test stuff...
### Should you use this system?
OH DEAR GOD, PLEASE DONT! the entire system is soooo janky, I mean its even called Janq, I even created a logo for it!
